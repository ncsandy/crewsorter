# Crew Sorter

The primary purpose of this program is to pair up flight crews. One being pilot in command and the other being pilot. So far, I am able to get the pair 
simple crews. Such as pilot in command and strictly pilot. There are other scenarios I will have to work on, such as a pilot in command can also serve as a 
pilot. Additionally, a holding area for the none paired crews.
