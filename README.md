# Crew Sorter

The primary purpose of this program is to pair up flight crews. There needs to be a pilot in command and co-pilot in the aircraft. This hasty program
sorts pilot in command along with co-pilots. There are some special cases where they are only pilot in commands, they can also serve as a 
co pilot. The program is able to solve this special scenario.

It stills need to be reworked for efficiency.
